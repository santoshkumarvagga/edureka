Adding ssh key to github acc prevents developer entering github username and github password everytime he pushes or pulls.

NOTE: The project should be pulled via SSH Keys, not on Https. from github UI.

1) First Look for existing keys(private and public keys) in ~/.ssh/, if no keys create using "ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com""
2) Add private key to ssh agent via ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
3) Add public key to Github list of SSH keys (copy content of id_rsa.pub to new ssh key entry in github acc)


Thats it!!

4) Clone your github project via SSH KEYS (git+ssh://git@github.com/username/reponame.git) and start pushing, pulling without annoying username and passwords.

5) If you have done the steps above and are still getting the password prompt, make sure your repo URL is in the form

git+ssh://git@github.com/username/reponame.git
as opposed to
https://github.com/username/reponame.git

To see your repo URL, run:
git remote show origin

You can change the URL with:
git remote set-url origin git+ssh://git@github.com/username/reponame.git
