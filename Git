Adding ssh key to github acc prevents developer entering github username and github password everytime he pushes or pulls.

NOTE: The project should be pulled via SSH Keys, not on Https. from github UI.

1) First Look for existing keys(private and public keys) in ~/.ssh/
2) Add private key to ssh agent via ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
3) Add public key to Github list of SSH keys (copy content of id_rsa.pub to new ssh key entry in github acc)

Thats it!!


Clone your github project via SSH KEYS and start pushing, pulling without annoying username and passwords.
